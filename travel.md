# Travel

- [Detour][1] – GPS based audio walking tours in the real world; highly recommended
- [Amazon Prime][2] – Gives access to ebooks, 2 day shipping, TV and Movies
- [AirBnB][3] – Rent someone’s apartment; cheaper and more personal than a hotel
- [Lyft][4] – Taxi you can call from your phone (avoid Uber—terrible business practices)
